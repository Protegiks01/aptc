## Title
DKG Transcript Decompression Bomb Vulnerability During Deserialization

## Summary
A resource exhaustion vulnerability exists in the DKG transcript processing flow where BCS deserialization of elliptic curve points occurs before size validation, allowing Byzantine validators to cause significant CPU consumption on all validators during critical DKG epochs.

## Finding Description

The vulnerability exists in the DKG (Distributed Key Generation) transcript validation flow where expensive cryptographic operations are performed before logical size checks.

**Attack Flow:**

1. A Byzantine validator submits a `ValidatorTransaction::DKGResult` containing a maliciously crafted DKG transcript with excessive elliptic curve points (staying within the 2MB transaction size limit).

2. During consensus proposal processing, `vtxn.verify()` is called which triggers `DKGTranscript::verify()`: [1](#0-0) 

3. The verification deserializes the transcript bytes without prior size validation: [2](#0-1) 

4. During VM processing, a second deserialization occurs: [3](#0-2) 

5. The `Transcript` structure contains vectors of G1 and G2 elliptic curve points: [4](#0-3) 

6. The BCS deserialization implementation explicitly performs expensive point validation during deserialization, as documented in the code: [5](#0-4) 

7. Only AFTER all elliptic curve points are decompressed and validated does the `verify()` method call `check_sizes()` to validate vector lengths: [6](#0-5) 

8. The size validation logic that would reject oversized transcripts: [7](#0-6) 

**Exploitation Details:**

With the default 2MB per-block validator transaction limit, an attacker can fit approximately 21,845 G2 points (96 bytes each compressed) or 43,690 G1 points (48 bytes each compressed): [8](#0-7) 

Each G2 point decompression involves:
- Extracting the x-coordinate from 96 bytes
- Computing y² = x³ + 4 in Fp2 (extension field arithmetic)
- Modular square root in Fp2 (expensive operation)
- Subgroup membership check

If the expected weight W is small (e.g., 100-500 for typical validator sets), but the attacker provides 20,000+ points, all validators must decompress these points before the mismatch is detected and the transcript rejected.

## Impact Explanation

This is a **High Severity** vulnerability per Aptos bug bounty criteria (Category 8: "Validator Node Slowdowns").

**Concrete Impact:**
- A single Byzantine validator (< 1/3 threshold) can repeatedly submit malicious DKG transcripts
- Each malicious transcript causes all validators to perform seconds of CPU-intensive elliptic curve operations
- Multiple such transactions during DKG epochs can significantly degrade validator performance
- DKG occurs during epoch transitions, a critical protocol phase where consensus liveness is essential
- No rate limiting or cost accounting exists for failed transcript processing

This breaks the protocol's resource limits invariant, which requires all operations to complete within bounded computational resources.

## Likelihood Explanation

**Likelihood: Medium to High**

**Factors increasing likelihood:**
- Byzantine validators (< 1/3 malicious) are explicitly within the threat model
- Attack requires only validator access, which malicious actors may obtain through stake or compromise
- Execution is trivial: craft oversized transcript vectors, submit via ValidatorTransaction
- No authentication or rate limiting prevents repeated attacks
- DKG happens at predictable times (epoch boundaries)

**Factors decreasing likelihood:**
- Requires attacker to be an active validator
- Detection may be possible through monitoring (though damage occurs before detection)

## Recommendation

Implement size validation BEFORE deserialization:

1. **Pre-deserialization size check**: Extract vector lengths from BCS bytes without full deserialization
2. **Early rejection**: Validate vector sizes against expected weight before triggering point decompression
3. **Rate limiting**: Implement per-validator limits on failed DKG transcript submissions
4. **Monitoring**: Add metrics for DKG transcript processing time to detect exploitation attempts

Suggested fix location: Before line 84 in `types/src/dkg/mod.rs`, add preliminary size validation that inspects BCS structure without deserializing points.

## Proof of Concept

The report does not include a runnable PoC, but the vulnerability is evident from code inspection. A PoC would involve:

1. Creating a `Transcript` with vectors containing 20,000+ G1/G2 points
2. Serializing to BCS bytes
3. Wrapping in `DKGTranscript` and `ValidatorTransaction::DKGResult`
4. Measuring deserialization time vs. expected legitimate transcript

The code evidence demonstrates that deserialization with expensive cryptographic validation occurs before logical size checks, confirming the vulnerability.

---

**Notes:**

The vulnerability is valid because:
- All affected files are in-scope components (consensus/, types/, crates/aptos-dkg/)
- Byzantine validators are untrusted actors within the < 1/3 threshold
- The impact (validator slowdowns) maps to High severity in the bug bounty framework
- The execution path is clearly traceable through the codebase
- No existing mitigations prevent this attack vector
