# Unable to Complete Security Audit - Incomplete Security Question

I cannot proceed with this security audit because **the security question is incomplete**. 

The provided query states:

> **Security Question (scope for this run):** [File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/rwlock.rs] [Function

The question cuts off after "[Function" without specifying:

1. **Which specific function** to analyze (the file contains `read()`, `write()`, `into_inner()`, `inner()`, and `new()`)
2. **What security concern** to investigate 
3. **What vulnerability scenario** or attack vector to explore

## Information Needed to Proceed

To conduct a proper security audit of this file, I would need the complete security question, such as:

- "[Function: `read()`] Can lock poisoning cause consensus failures?"
- "[Function: `write()`] Can panic on poisoned lock lead to denial of service?"
- "[Function: `expect()` usage] What are the security implications of unhandled lock poisoning?"

## Context About the File

The file `crates/aptos-infallible/src/rwlock.rs` is a thin wrapper around Rust's standard `RwLock` that calls `.expect()` on lock acquisition instead of propagating errors. [1](#0-0) 

Without knowing which specific aspect you want me to investigate, I cannot:
- Determine relevant attack surfaces
- Trace exploitation paths through the codebase
- Assess impact against Aptos invariants
- Provide meaningful recommendations

**Please provide the complete security question so I can conduct a thorough security analysis.**
