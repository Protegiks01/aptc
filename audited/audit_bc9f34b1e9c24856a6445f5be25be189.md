I notice that the **Security Question (scope for this run)** section in your prompt appears to be incomplete. The query shows:

```
**Security Question (scope for this run):** [File:

### Citations

**File:** aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/versioned_group_data.rs (L1-1936)
```

The actual security question that I should investigate is missing. The prompt cuts off after `[File:` and only includes a file citation reference.

**To proceed with a security audit, I need:**

1. **The complete security question** - What specific vulnerability scenario, attack vector, or security concern should I investigate in the Aptos Core codebase?

2. **The scope definition** - For example:
   - "Can race conditions in versioned_group_data.rs lead to state inconsistencies?"
   - "Can malicious transactions exploit the MVHashMap implementation to cause consensus splits?"
   - "Are there determinism issues in the BlockSTM execution that could break consensus?"

Without a specific security question to investigate, I cannot:
- Determine which code paths to trace
- Identify relevant invariants to validate
- Assess potential attack vectors
- Produce a meaningful audit report

**Please provide the complete security question you want me to investigate**, and I will perform a thorough analysis following the detailed audit framework you've provided.
