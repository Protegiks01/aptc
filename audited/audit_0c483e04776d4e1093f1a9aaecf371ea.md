I cannot proceed with this security audit because **the security question is incomplete**.

The prompt states:
> **Security Question (scope for this run):** [File: aptos-labs/aptos-core

This appears to be truncated or malformed. There is no actual security question or vulnerability scenario provided for me to investigate.

To perform the thorough security audit you've requested, I need:

1. **A complete security question** - For example:
   - "Can a malicious validator manipulate consensus votes to cause safety violations?"
   - "Is there a gas metering bypass in the Move VM's native function implementations?"
   - "Can governance voting power be manipulated through stake pool state corruption?"
   - etc.

2. **The specific scope or attack vector** to investigate within the Aptos Core codebase

Without a concrete security question, I cannot:
- Identify relevant code paths to analyze
- Determine which invariants to validate
- Trace attack vectors through the system
- Produce a meaningful audit report

**Please provide the complete security question**, and I will perform a comprehensive security audit following all the requirements and validation criteria you've outlined.
