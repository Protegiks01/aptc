I notice that your security query is **incomplete**. The security question that I'm supposed to investigate is cut off:

**Your query states:**
```
**Security Question (scope for this run):** [File: aptos-
```

And then the code snippet in the citation also appears to be truncated mid-line:

```rust
self.should_leak_memory_for_native = (*module_id.address() == CORE_CODE_ADDRESS
            && module_id.name().as_str() ==
```

**To perform the security audit you've requested, I need:**

1. **The complete security question** - What specific security concern or potential vulnerability should I investigate in the Aptos Core codebase?

2. **The complete context** - If you're pointing to a specific file or code pattern, please provide the full file path and any specific functions or areas of concern.

Without a clearly defined security question, I cannot:
- Trace relevant code paths
- Identify potential vulnerabilities
- Determine which invariants might be violated
- Assess impact and likelihood
- Provide concrete recommendations

**Please provide the complete security question**, and I'll conduct a thorough security analysis following the audit framework you've outlined.
