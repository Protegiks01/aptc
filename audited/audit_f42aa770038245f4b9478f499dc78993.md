## Unable to Proceed: Incomplete Security Question

I cannot perform the requested security audit because **the security question is incomplete**.

The prompt states:

> **Security Question (scope for this run):** [File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/

This appears to be cut off mid-sentence. There is no actual security concern, vulnerability hypothesis, or specific question being asked about the indexer-grpc component.

### What I Found

I examined the referenced file: [1](#0-0) 

This file contains backup/restore metadata handling for the indexer-grpc component, but without a **specific security question** to investigate, I cannot:

1. ✗ Determine which attack vectors to explore
2. ✗ Identify which invariants might be violated
3. ✗ Trace relevant execution paths
4. ✗ Validate potential vulnerabilities against specific criteria
5. ✗ Provide a meaningful security assessment

### What I Need

To conduct a proper security audit, please provide a **complete security question** such as:

- "Can the backup_restore metadata deserialization be exploited to cause DoS?"
- "Are there path traversal vulnerabilities in the backup file naming scheme?"
- "Can malicious backup files corrupt indexer state?"
- "Is there insufficient validation of chain_id/epoch parameters?"

### Conclusion

Per the audit instructions: **"Do not fabricate or exaggerate issues."** Without a clear security question, I cannot proceed with the investigation.

Please provide the complete security question you wish me to investigate regarding the indexer-grpc component.
